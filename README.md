# Learning How to Create Websites

Welcome to my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS learning projects repository! This repository contains various projects where I explore and learn how to create websites using these fundamental web technologies.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find multiple folders, each representing a separate website project. Each project is designed to help you understand how to build and style websites from scratch. Here's a brief overview of the structure and content of each project:

- **`index.html`**: This file contains the basic structure of the website, including the HTML markup that defines the content and layout.
- **`index.js`**: This JavaScript file holds the methods and functions used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website.
- **`style.css`**: This CSS file is used to personalize and style the website's appearance, including colors, fonts, and layout adjustments.

## How to Run the Projects

To view and test these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Learning-how-to-create-a-Website/folder_name
   ```
   Note: Replace folder_name with the specific folder name for the website example you wish to view. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different project or website example. For instance, if you want to work on the "counter" example, navigate to the folder    named counter.

3. **Open the index.html File:**
Using VSCode: Install the "Live Server" extension. Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server."
Using Visual Studio: You can use the built-in server features to preview the index.html file.
Using IntelliJ IDEA: Install the "LiveServer" plugin and use it to open the index.html file.
